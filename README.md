# How it works 
This is just a simple program to add files, commit, and push to github. It's my very fist script so is very basic and simple.

Exec the program with 2 arguments, first the name of the commit and the name of the branch
Exemple:

```shell
bash simplegit.sh "First commit" main
```

Doing like this the script will work well
